## Problem
New slash commands weren't appearing in `/ltm:help` output, and help formatting was inconsistent (sometimes list, sometimes table).

## Solution

### 1. YAML Frontmatter Required
Every slash command `.md` file MUST have YAML frontmatter with a `description` field:

```yaml
---
description: Brief description of the command
---

# Command Title
...
```

Without this frontmatter, the command:
- Still works if invoked directly
- Does NOT appear in dynamically-generated help lists
- Is not discoverable via tab completion

### 2. Explicit Help Formatting
Claude interprets help command instructions and may vary output format. To ensure consistent formatting, use explicit instructions:

```markdown
## Instructions

Output the following text EXACTLY as shown, preserving the formatting. Do not use tables or alternative formats:

```
Command list here...
```
```

### Key Learnings
- Claude Code discovers commands by scanning `.md` files with YAML frontmatter
- The `description` field is used for help lists and tab completion
- Help commands don't literally copy code blocks - they interpret and regenerate
- Explicit "EXACTLY as shown" instructions enforce consistent output
